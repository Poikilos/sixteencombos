# Rules in Linear Format

The official rules are in (Sixteen_Combos-Rules.odt)[../Sixteen_Combos-Rules.odt].

However, if you are here you are probably trying to view the rules online. If so, this information may help:
- Combo Table: See [../../readme.md](../../readme.md)
- [Sixteen_Combos-Rules.md](Sixteen_Combos-Rules.md) only has combos in text format (See the point below for why) so use the link above for that--for everything else this link is mostly to completely usable to see the rest of the rules.
  - Technically Sixteen_Combos-Rules.md is only here to track changes to the text in git history or using the `diff` command. The file is likely not formatted correctly if viewed using a Markdown viewer or plain
text editor. The official rules are in the odt file further up.

## Official vs Custom Rules
See "Official vs Custom Rules" in the main [readme.md](../../readme.md).
