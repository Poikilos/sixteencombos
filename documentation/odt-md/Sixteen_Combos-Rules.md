 2022-02-14 |


16 Combos is an
*ultra-advanced* (lol) card game such as for people who find
regular card games repetitive. I invented this game while watching
other people play various games that use playing cards. The games
were uninspiring, so the game is mostly inspired by role-playing
games :). 16 Combos ([16combos.com](https://16combos.com/)) by Poikilos (the author
of The Path of Resistance [[zahyest.com](https://zahyest.com/)]) is also a multi-player turn-based battle system using playing
cards! You don't need a computer: 16 Combos has multiple dimensions
of gameplay while requiring only playing cards and counters (such
as coins, chips, bingo counters, or something on which to write
numbers).


  



What
makes the game interesting is that it isn’t just a game of “this
number vs that number” like most card games. The meanings of
the suits are: ♥ vitality ♦ wealth ♣ strength ♠ finesse and these are called the
four types.
There can be 16 different actions depending on the
combination of the target type (that your opponent has) and
the action type you choose (See “Combo Table”). Each rule has a name
(underlined where
defined) for easy
reference.


Requirements


* (2) decks of cards,
 one deck having backs being clearly different from the other
 deck. Each deck having jokers is recommended but not
 required.
* Counters: You can
 use any type of numbered devices or countable devices for
 counters which will show the value of a value card that has
 changed. Examples: You can use small pieces of paper (and
 pencil so you can erase and change the number on it, otherwise
 many numbered pieces), a large dry-erase board under the cards,
 a third deck of cards so you can swap the card for one with a
 new value, coins, chips, or bingo counters to determine the
 value of any value card that has changed in value. See the
 “Reusing Value Cards” Optional Rule.


**D****ealing**
**Steps**


Number of Cards: The example surface below uses two characters (such as
two players with one
character each; there could be either more players or each player
could have more than one character). You can choose to start with
fewer or more columns but at least 10 is recommended
to try a variety of combos (See the “One
of Each Type” Optional Rule).


* Decide Optional
 Rules: Players must have know what
 optional rules are in effect before
 preparing pairs.
* Target Type Order:
Type cards are dealt from left to
 right.
* Preparing Pairs:
 The rest of the cards
dealt to the player are placed by the player. For
 example, if the
 player places a 5 in front of any heart card the player has 5
 vitality when that pair is targeted (The “Drop
 Lowest Dealt” Optional Rule
affects this step).
* Show Defense Pair Type: The defense
 pair (rightmost) always has the type card face up unless a rule
 or combo says otherwise.

Combo
Table


The chart is supposed
to mimic real life: For example, if you use your vitality against
someone’s wealth, you dig through the trash and try to overcome the
opponent’s wealth that way (See “Scavenge” on the chart). Below are
underlined steps for a turn.


Target Character: Announce the target character when
your turn starts *(If you yourself have more
than one character [only if you have more than two rows of cards],
first announce what character is doing the action)*.
Defense Pair: The defense pair of the
target character is the target*. Choose an Action
Type: Choose an *available* action type (one of the
four types, limited by the Available Actions rule) and announce
which, such as “I use vitality”. Reaction:
The target player can make changes to their defense now even if the
action is a surprise action There is only one reaction per turn.
Draw a Value: Draw a card from the draw
pile then use the “Check” rule to determine the outcome:
“defeated”, “damaged” or “critical failure”. The target type card
determines the action. The action occurs successfully only if the
target pair is defeated. For example, if you choose vitality as
your action type, use the first column, and if the target pair’s
type card is wealth then your action is *Scavenge*. If the
outcome is damage, the action doesn’t occur*, but the target’s
value card is reduced in value. On a critical failure, your
character becomes the target and the target pair is your defense
pair*.








| Action Type:
Target Type | ♥ vitality | ♦ wealth | ♣ strength | ♠ finesse |
| ♥ vit | Poison: Any remaining attack
 value that didn’t go toward reducing the target to zero does
 damage to the next pair to their left (to right if none
 there). | Hire Assassin: Get another
 turn and choose any pair to target (announce an action type
 and draw a new value card). ***** | Throw: You get to switch any
 two defense pairs of the target and if one pair becomes the
 defense pair, the type card becomes face up. | Insight: The target
 character turns one card you choose face up. ***** |
| ♦ wth | Scavenge: Draw two value
 cards on your next attack and either add them together or
 choose to take the waste value and then discard the two drawn
 (the second drawn becomes the new waste card). **** The
 target pair isn’t affected. | Bribe: The target character
 decides whether to accept your value card as a wild card but
 still loses the target pair. **** | Steal: You get the defense
 pair & add it to the right of your defense pair as your
 new defense pair or use its type and value as your next
 action. ***** | Snipe: Change the damaged or
 defeated target to any of the opponent’s pairs but only
 affect that pair (& ignore the type). ***** |
| ♣ str | Defend: Place the drawn card
 on top of any card in your value row to increase the pair’s
 value. *** The target pair is not discarded. | Hire Guard: Replace any of
 your target type cards with either card you are using (If you
 use the drawn card, discard the replaced card, otherwise swap
 the replaced card and used card). | Grapple: You get an extra
 turn & use an action on the target character’s next pair
 (next to their defense pair) but their current target pair
 returns to play at the start of their next turn. Unless there
 is a critical failure, the target pair both become face up.
 ** | Stealth: Switch any pair in
 your defense with another pair but keep both new defense
 cards face down. ***** |
| ♠ fin | Adrenaline: Place the value
 card from the drawn pair on top of your defense pair’s target
 value card to increase its value.***, ***** | Consultation: Draw a second
 card as a type, face up. Place the drawn pair above your
 defense pair. The next time you are targeted, you can choose
 to have the action affect your consultation pair instead of
 defense pair, but discard the other pair). | Shove: The target character
 must use their defense pair and value as their action type
 and value on their next turn (ignores “Available Actions”
 rule & doesn’t draw a value card). | Dodge: Switch any pair in
 your defense with another pair (The new type card becomes
 face up & each card in the old pair remains up only if it
 was). |


* Override: Unless a combo affects that. ** Second Turn: You can’t use a two-turn action if you
get a second action (if the defense changes due to another rule or
combo, you have to change the type or lose the second turn if you
have no attack type that doesn’t have a two-turn action) *** Use
Maximum Value rule **** Ignore Maximum Value rule **** Use Wild
Card rule


***** Surprise: Regardless of other rules or combos, the
target can’t make changes to their target pair in any way after the
action value is revealed (but they can do so before).

Rules for
Playing


1. Character Order: Before playing, each
character gets one order
card from the top of the draw pile
(one for each character if the
player has more than
one [two rows is one
character]) and
keeps it face up for the entire match. In
each round, characters take turns in order from
highest to lowest order card. Alternatively, use “Round-robin Order” from the Optional
Rules. When your character’s turn occurs
your character is called the active
character and you are the
active player.


2. Available Actions: The active (including countering)
character can pass instead of taking an
action * (unless shoved etc.). Your
available action types are any where you have two of the type
in your value (front) row, or one there if it
matches the type of the value
card (usually
drawn).


3. Determine
Type and Value: Each attack or defense has a
pair, one card being used as the type and
one card being used as the value
(Keep track of the value another way if using the
“Reusing Value Cards” optional rule).


a. Attack Value: In the case of an attack, the value is determined by drawing
a new card after choosing an attack
type unless another rule sets the
value.


4. Check: Whenever the defense card’s type and value must be known, that
is called a check. The target doesn’t have to reveal the
number if there is a ref or proof—the target can just say, the attack
“destroyed,”
“damaged,” or
“critically failed.”


* Proving the Outcome:
If one of the target pair’s cards is face down, the
active player can
 either take the target’s word for what the type
 and value card are, ask “show
 me” (but
the player can show
 only the type [suit] or value if only one or the
 other is required), or someone can be a ref
and view the card or view a record of
the card that the ref
 recorded or ensured that someone else including the attacker
 recorded correctly.
* Outcomes of a Check:
The difference
is determined as follows: action value
 card’s value minus target value card’s current value. The difference ranges from 12 to -12 (Joker
[14] minus 2; or if no
 Jokers then 11 which is Ace minus 2 to
 -11). There are
 3 outcomes of a
 check:


	+ Defeated: 6 to 12: The
	action defeats the
	target pair
	(it is
	 discarded, and the value
	replaces the waste
	 value). If you lose a check, discard
	 the pair (See also: “Discard Pile”). *
	+ Damaged: 1
	to 5: The action doesn’t occur*
	but damages the
	 defense value card.
	+ Missed: -5 to 0: The action does nothing and doesn’t
	 successfully occur.
	+ Critical Failure:
	-12 to -6:
	 The action is a critical
	 failure.
	
	
		- Counter: In the case of a critical failure,
		 the target can choose to
		 perform a counter action
		using the defense pair’s type and
		 value (See also:
		 “Recovery” in
		Optional Rules).
	+ Discard Attack Value Card: In any of the four
	outcomes, you
	 discard the attack value card*.


5. Maximum Value: A target pair’s value card’s value can
never be more than 14, but if it is 14 or more it behaves as a
Joker.


6. Face Cards: Face cards can be used to change the type
if drawn as an attack value card, optionally, as shown below. The
type in parenthesis below is non-optional if the face card is used
as a target pair’s type card. Whether used as action or target, and
whether used as type or value, the player can optionally swap the
position of the type and value cards (If attacking, swap with
either type card if you have two of the type in your value [front]
row) after the action value is known to the person with the face
card.


* Jack: 11 (strength)
* King/Queen: 12 (wealth)
* Ace: 13 (finesse)
* Joker: 14 (The target using it decides finesse or
 health each time the pair is targeted, but
 after action type and value is revealed unless the action is a surprise
action.
The active
 character decides the type on announcing their action
 type.)


7. Discard Pile and Waste:
Discarded cards other than the most recently discarded point
card(s) goes into the discard pile face down. The last value
card(s) discarded is left face up beside the discard pile. It is
called the waste. The waste goes into the pile face down like the
others the next time a card(s) is discarded.


  



Optional
Rules


A. Recovery: On
a critical failure, the target can take the attacker’s value card and can add it to any defense value
(see the Maximum Defense rule).


B. Reusing Value Cards: You can replace a value card with
some kind of counter as soon as it is drawn (and you can discard it
at that time but discard it before the drawn card) if you have some
other way of determining its face (such as drawing on a dry erase
board under the counter(s)). You can hide the face in accordance
with other rules.


C. Drop Lowest Dealt: You can give each player one extra
value card and they must discard one card after arranging
them.


D. Round-robin Order: Have the player with the highest card
go first at the beginning of the game, and
choose an order such as clockwise or counter-clockwise to make
determining turns easier.


E. One of Each
Type: You get four pairs, one of each type.
No cards are face up except that one*. The number gets added to the
value of the value card unless using the “Multiple Values Dealt”
Optional Rule. Choose defense pair at end
of your every turn.


F. Multiple Values
Dealt: Use the “Drop Lowest Dealt” dealing
but stack instead of discarding values (“Maximum Value”
applies).


* Unless another rule
or a combo says otherwise
