 1.0 RC1 |


16 Combos is an
*ultra-advanced* (lol) card game such as for people who find
regular card games repetitive. I invented this game while watching
other people play various games that use playing cards. The games
were uninspiring, so the game is mostly inspired by role-playing
games :). 16 Combos ([16combos.com](https://16combos.com/)) by Poikilos (the author
of The Path of Resistance [[zahyest.com](https://zahyest.com/)]) is also a multi-player turn-based battle system using playing
cards! You don't need a computer: 16 Combos has multiple dimensions
of gameplay while requiring only playing cards and counters (such
as coins, chips, bingo counters, or something on which to write
numbers).






What
makes the game interesting is that it isn’t just a game of “this
number vs that number” like most card games. The meanings of
the suits are: ♥ vitality ♦ wealth ♣ strength and ♠ finesse. These are called the four
types. There can be 16 different actions depending on the combination
of the target type (that your opponent has) and the action
type you choose (See “Combo Table”).
Each rule has a name (underlined
where defined) for easy
reference.


Requirements


* Two Decks of Cards: Use two decks, one deck having backs being
 clearly different from the other deck. Each deck having jokers
 is recommended but not required. One deck becomes the draw pile
 and the other deck is used for dealing. See
 the “Using Jokers” Optional Rule and “Face Cards”
 rules for how to use
 jokers.
* Counters: You can use any type of numbered devices
 or countable devices for counters which will show the value of
 a value card that has changed. Examples: You can use small
 pieces of paper (and pencil so you can erase and change the
 number on it, otherwise many numbered pieces), a large
 dry-erase board or paper under the cards, a third deck of cards
 so you can swap the card for one with a new value, coins,
 chips, or bingo counters to determine the value of any value
 card that has changed in value. See the “Reusing Value Cards”
 Optional Rule.


**D****ealing**
**Steps**


Number of Cards: The example surface below uses two characters (such as
two players with one
character each; there could be either more players or each player
could have more than one character). You can choose to start with
fewer or more columns but at least 10 is recommended
to try a variety of combos (See the “One
of Each Type” Optional Rule).


* Decide Optional
 Rules: Players must have know what
 optional rules are in effect before
 preparing pairs.
* Target Type Order:
Type cards are dealt from left to
 right.
* Preparing Pairs:
 The rest of the cards
dealt to the player are placed by the player. For
 example, if the
 player places a 5 in front of any heart card the player has 5
 vitality when that pair is targeted (The “Drop
 Lowest Dealt” Optional Rule
affects this step).
* Show Defense Pair Type: The defense
 pair (rightmost) always has the type card face up unless a rule
 or combo says otherwise.

Steps on Your
Turn


Target Character: Announce the target character when
your turn starts *(If you yourself have more
than one character [only if you have more than two rows of cards],
first announce what character is doing the action)*.
Defense Pair: The defense pair of the
target character is the target*. Choose an Action
Type: Choose an *available* action type (one of the
four types, limited by the Available Actions rule) and announce
which, such as “I use vitality”. Predictive
Reaction: The target player can
make changes to their defense now using the “Face Cards” rules or
other rules even if the action is a surprise action. Draw a Value: Draw a card from the draw pile then
reveal it. Informed Reaction: If your action is a surprise action, the
target character can take their reaction only as a “Predictive
Reaction” not after seeing your finalized value; at either then or
now if not a surprise action (only 1 reaction per round [0 on
successive turns in the round] and a counter action counts as the
one reaction per turn as well). Action: If
you draw a face card follow the “Face Cards” rules (which includes
announcing a new type if different) then announce the value such as
“level 10”. Use the “Check” rules to determine the outcome: For
example, if you choose vitality as your action type, use the first
column, and if the target pair’s type card is wealth and the
outcome is “defeated” then your action is *Scavenge*. The
caveats of actions in the combo table are in italics and are
defined below the combo table.


Combo
Table


The table is supposed
to mimic real life: For example, if you use your vitality against
someone’s wealth, you dig through the trash and try to overcome the
opponent’s wealth that way (“Scavenge”). Static
Type: Increasing a value doesn’t affect a pair’s
type*.![](../images/combo-table.png)








| Action Type:
Target Type | ♥ vitality | ♦ wealth | ♣ strength | ♠ finesse |
| ♥ vit | **Poison**: Any
 remaining action value that didn’t go toward reducing the
 target to zero does damage to the next pair to their left
 (start from right end if none are left of target). | **Hire**
**Assassin**: Get another turn and choose any pair to
 target (announce an action type and draw a new value card).
 (*Surprise*) | **Throw**: You get to
 switch any two defense pairs of the target and if one pair
 becomes the defense pair, the type card becomes face up.
 (*Incapacitated*) | **Insight**: The target
 character turns one card you choose face up.
 (*Surprise*) |
| ♦ wth | **Scavenge**: Draw two
 value cards on your next action and either add them together
 or choose to take the waste value and then discard the two
 drawn (the second drawn becomes the new waste card).
 (*Unlimited, Passive*) | **Bribe**: The target
 character decides whether to accept your value card as a wild
 card but still loses the target pair. (*Save
 Wild*) | **Steal**: You get the
 defense pair & add it to the right of your defense pair
 as your new defense pair or use its type and value as your
 next action. (*Surprise*) | **Snipe**: Change the
 damaged or defeated target to any of the opponent’s pairs but
 only affect that pair (& ignore the type).
 (*Surprise*) |
| ♣ str | **Defend**: Place the
 drawn card on top of any card in your value row to increase
 the pair’s value for one round (*Unlimited,*
*Passive*). | **Hire Guard**: Replace
 any of your target type cards with either card you are using
 (If you use the drawn card, discard the replaced card,
 otherwise swap the replaced card and used card). | **Grapple**: You get an
 extra turn & use an action on the target character’s next
 pair (next to their defense pair) but their current target
 pair returns to play at the start of their next turn. Unless
 there is a critical failure, the target pair both become face
 up. (*Once,* *Incapacitated*) | **Stealth**: Switch any
 pair in your defense with another pair but keep both new
 defense cards face down. (*Surprise*) |
| ♠ fin | **Adrenaline**: Place
 the value card from the drawn pair on top of your defense
 pair’s target value card to increase its value. (*Limited,
 Surprise*) | **Consultation**: Draw a
 second card as a type, face up. Place the drawn pair above
 your defense pair. The next time your character is targeted,
 choose to have the action affect your consultation pair
 instead of defense pair (then discard the other
 pair). | **Shove**: The target
 character must use their defense pair and value as their
 action type and value on their next turn (The character
 ignores the “Available Actions” rule & doesn’t draw a
 value card). (*Incapacitated*) | **Dodge**: Switch any
 pair in your defense with another pair (The new type card
 becomes face up & each card in the old pair remains up
 only if it was). |


* Unless another combo
or rule affects that. Once: You can’t get
the effect of a two-turn action if you are using it as a second
action but you can still cause damage or defeat. The second turn
uses your reaction for the round. Limited:
Use the “Maximum Value” rule. Passive: The
target pair is neither damaged nor defeated/discarded*.
Save Wild: Use the “Wild Card” rule.
Surprise: Regardless of other rules or
combos, the target can’t make changes to their target pair in any
way after the action value is revealed (but they can do so on their
“Predictive Reaction” but not their “Informed Reaction”).
Unlimited: Ignore
the “Maximum Value” rule. Incapacitated:
On a “defeated” or “damaged” outcome, The target character can’t
use an action nor reaction until their turn next round.

Rules for
Playing


1. Character Order: Before playing, each
character gets one order
card from the top of the draw pile
(one for each character if the
player has more than
one [two rows is one
character]) and
keeps it face up for the entire match. In
each round, characters take turns in order from
highest to lowest order card. Alternatively, use “Round-robin Order” from the Optional
Rules. When your character’s turn occurs
your character is called the active
character and you are the
active player.


2. Available Actions: The active (including countering)
character can pass instead of taking an
action * (unless shoved etc.). Your
available action types are any where you have two of the type
in your value (front) row, or one there if it
matches the type of the value
card (usually
drawn).


3. Determine
Type and Value: Each action or target uses a pair,
one card being used as the type and one card (or more if changes) being used as the
value (Keep track of the value another way
if using the “Reusing Value Cards” optional
rule). The
“Face Card” rule can alter
this.


a. Action Value: In the case of an
action, the value is
determined by drawing a new card* after
choosing an action.


b. Advantage:
If you have advantage, draw an extra value card and use it if
higher (but the extra card
can’t be kept).


4. Check: Whenever the defense card’s type and value must be known, that
is called a check. The target doesn’t have to reveal the
number if there is a ref or proof—the target can just say, the
action “defeated,”
“damaged,”
“missed,” or
“critically failed.”


* Proving the Outcome:
If one of the target pair’s cards is face down, the
active player can
 either take the target’s word for what the type
 and value card are, ask “show
 me” (but
the player can show
 only the type [suit] or value if only one or the
 other is required), or someone can be a ref
and view the card or view a record of
the card that the ref
 recorded or ensured that someone else including
an opposing player recorded correctly.
* Outcomes of a Check:
The difference
is determined as follows: action value
 card’s value minus target value card’s current value. The difference ranges from 12 to -12 (Joker
[14] minus 2; or if no
 Jokers then 11 which is Ace minus 2 to
 -11). There are
 3 outcomes of a
 check:


	+ Defeated: 6 to 12: The
	action defeats the
	target pair
	(it is
	 discarded, and the value
	replaces the waste
	 value). If you lose a check, discard
	 the pair (See also: “Discard Pile”). *
	+ Damaged: 1
	to 5: The action doesn’t occur*
	but damages the
	 defense value card.
	+ Missed: -5 to 0: The action does nothing and doesn’t
	 successfully occur.
	+ Critical Failure:
	-12 to -6:
	 The action is a critical failure.
	Lost Reaction: The active character loses
	 their reaction for the round.


		- Counter: In the case of a critical failure,
		 the target can choose to
		 perform a counter action
		using the defense pair’s type and
		 value (See also:
		 “Recovery” in
		Optional Rules). The counter counts as a
		 reaction and the character can only perform one
		 reaction per round.
* Discard the Action
Value Card:
In any of the
four outcomes, you discard the
action value
 card*.


5. Maximum Value: A target pair’s value card’s value can
never be more than 14, but if it is 14 or more it behaves as a
Joker.


6. Face Cards: Face Card as Target
Value (When you’re targeted): Face
cards can be used to optionally change the type if used as a value
card. You can optionally swap the cards. The change or swap is your
reaction—doing neither (using only the value when already in the
value card position) isn’t. Face Card as Action
Value (On your turn): Swap the
value face card with either type card if you have two of the type in your
value [front] row but it
must be the action type you originally announced; change or
swap after drawing and before doing
anything else—while announcing
the value, announce the new action type
if that type was not announced yet, such as
“level 10 vitality”.


* Jack: 11 (strength)
* King/Queen: 12 (wealth)
* Ace: 13 (finesse)
* Joker: 14 (choose finesse or
vitality)


7. Discard Pile and Waste:
Discarded cards other than the most recently discarded point
card(s) goes into the discard pile face down. The last value
card(s) discarded is left face up beside the discard pile. It is
called the waste. The waste goes into the pile face down like the
others the next time a card(s) is discarded.






Optional
Rules


A. Recovery: On
a critical failure, the target can take the active character’s
value card and can add it to any
defense value
(see the Maximum Defense rule).


B. Reusing Value Cards: You can replace a value card with
some kind of counter as soon as it is drawn (and you can discard it
at that time but discard it before the drawn card) if you have some
other way of determining its face (such as drawing on a dry erase
board under the counter(s)). You can hide the face in accordance
with other rules.


C. Drop Lowest Dealt: You can give each player one extra
value card and they must discard one card after arranging
them.


D. Round-robin Order: Have the player with the highest card
go first at the beginning of the game, and
choose an order such as clockwise or counter-clockwise to make
determining turns easier.


E. One of Each
Type: You get four pairs, one of each type.
No cards are face up except the defense
pair*, but you can choose the defense pair on the “Preparing Pairs”
dealing step. The number gets added to the
value of the value card unless using the “Multiple Values Dealt”
Optional Rule. Change
Stance: You can change the
defense pair at end of each of your turns (but not reactions or counters nor on a critical
failure) by moving the pair slightly more
forward than your rows and placing the type
card face up (The other can go face down unless it was forced up)
unless incapacitated.


F. Multiple Values
Dealt: Use the “Drop Lowest Dealt” dealing
but stack instead of discarding values (“Maximum Value”
applies).


G. Using Jokers:
If using Jokers, there must be exactly two for consistency.


* Unless another rule
or a combo says otherwise
