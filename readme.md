# 16 Combos
16 Combos is an *ultra-advanced* (:laughing:) card game such as for people who find regular card games repetitive. I invented this game while watching other people play various games that use playing cards. The games were uninspiring, so the game is mostly inspired by role-playing games :smile:. 16 Combos (16combos.com) by Poikilos (the author of [The Path of Resistance](https://zahyest.com)) is also a multi-player turn-based battle system using playing cards! You don't need a computer: 16 Combos has multiple dimensions of gameplay while requiring only playing cards and counters (such as coins, chips, bingo counters, or something on which to write numbers).

What makes the game interesting is that it isn’t just a game of “this number vs that number” like most card games. There can be 16 different actions depending on the combination of the attack and defense.

## Combo Table

![Combo table (same table as in the documenation in text form)](documentation/images/combo-table.png)
`*` <ins>Override</ins>: Unless a combo affects that.\
`**` <ins>Second Turn</ins>: You can’t use a two-turn action if you get a second action (if the defense changes due to another rule or combo, you have to change the type or lose the second turn if you have no attack type that doesn’t have a two-turn action)\
`***` Use Maximum Value rule\
`****` Ignore Maximum Value rule  **** Use Wild Card rule\
`*****` <ins>Surprise</ins>: Regardless of other rules or combos, the target can’t make changes to their target pair in any way after the action value is revealed (but they can do so before).


## How Cards are Arranged

## Rules
A printable copy of the rules is in the "[documentation](documentation/)" folder.

### Official vs Custom Rules
To prevent confusion (To ensure that players know the rules), the following rules usage is recommended:
- The behavior of any official computer code should match the rules in the official rules document. If not, please report an issue (first ensuring it is not already an issue by searching for related terms using the search bar on the [Issues](https://github.com/poikilos/sixteencombos/issues) page--erase "open" then type then press enter to search for open and closed issues--if the issue is closed, you should try to update).
- For unofficial rule documents or code, the documents or running program may use the official rules but should specify the complete ruleset name such as "Poikilos 2022-02-14" or whatever is at the top right corner of the version of the rules document you are using.
- If using custom rules, the document or running program should make clear to all users the custom ruleset name (title/author, and if necessary, the edition and/or version/date).
  - A custom ruleset's ruleset name must not be the same as the ruleset name (author+date) at the top right of the official rules document.
- In either case (following official or custom rules), the document or running program should also make clear to all users what optional rules are active before an encounter begins (such as in a welcome screen when joining the game or in a menu) if the ruleset has optional rules (The official rules contains optional rules).
